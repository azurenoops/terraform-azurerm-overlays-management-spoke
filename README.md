# Azure Virtual Network Management Spoke Terraform Module

[![Changelog](https://img.shields.io/badge/changelog-release-green.svg)](CHANGELOG.md) [![Notice](https://img.shields.io/badge/notice-copyright-yellow.svg)](NOTICE) [![MIT License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-orange.svg)](LICENSE) [![TF Registry](https://img.shields.io/badge/terraform-registry-blue.svg)](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/azurenoops/overlays-management-spoke/azurerm/)

This Overlay terraform module deploys a Management spoke network using the [Microsoft recommended Hub-Spoke network topology](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/reference-architectures/hybrid-networking/hub-spoke) to be used in a [SCCA compliant Management Network](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/azurenoops/overlays-management-hub/azurerm/latest). Usually, only one hub in each region with multiple spokes and each of them can also be in separate subscriptions.

>If you are deploying the spoke VNet in the same Hub Management Network subscription, then make sure you have set the argument `is_spoke_deployed_to_same_hub_subscription = true`. This helps this module to manage the network watcher, flow logs and traffic analytics resources for all the subnets in the Virtual Network. If you are deploying the spoke virtual networks in separate subscriptions, then set this argument to `false`.

This is designed to quickly deploy hub and spoke architecture in the azure and further security hardening would be recommend to add appropriate NSG rules to use this for any production workloads.

## SCCA Compliance

This module can be SCCA compliant and can be used in a SCCA compliant Network. Enable private endpoints and SCCA compliant network rules to make it SCCA compliant.

For more information, please read the [SCCA documentation]("https://www.cisa.gov/secure-cloud-computing-architecture").

## Management Spoke Architecture

The following reference architecture shows how to implement a SCCA compliant hub-spoke topology in Azure. The Management spoke virtual networks connect with the hub and can be used to isolate management workloads. Management Spokes can exist in different subscriptions and represent different environments, such as Production and Non-production.

  # set `enable_forced_tunneling = false`.
  enable_forced_tunneling_on_route_table = true

  # Private DNS Zone Settings
  # By default, Azure NoOps will create Private DNS Zones for Logging in Hub VNet.
  # If you do want to create addtional Private DNS Zones, 
  # add in the list of private_dns_zones to be created.

  enable_resource_locks = false

  # Tags
  add_tags = {
    Example = "Management Identity Core Spoke"
  } # Tags to be applied to all resources
}
```

## Create resource group

By default, this module will create a resource group and the name of the resource group to be given in an argument `resource_group_name`. If you want to use an existing resource group, specify the existing resource group name, and set the argument to `create_resource_group = false`.

> *If you are using an existing resource group, then this module uses the same resource group location to create all resources in this module.*

## Azure Network DDoS Protection Plan

By default, this module will not create a DDoS Protection Plan. You can enable/disable it by appending an argument `create_ddos_plan`. If you want to enable a DDoS plan using this module, set argument `create_ddos_plan = true`

## Custom DNS servers

This is an optional feature and only applicable if you are using your own DNS servers superseding default DNS services provided by Azure.Set the argument `dns_servers = ["4.4.4.4"]` to enable this option. For multiple DNS servers, set the argument `dns_servers = ["4.4.4.4", "8.8.8.8"]`

## Subnets

This module handles the creation and a list of address spaces for subnets. This module uses `for_each` to create subnets and corresponding service endpoints, service delegation, and network security groups. This module associates the subnets to network security groups as well with additional user-defined NSG rules.  

This module creates 2 subnets by default: Application Subnet and Database Subnet and both subnets route the traffic through the firewall if `hub_firewall_private_ip_address` argument set else all traffic will forward to VNet.

## Virtual Network service endpoints

Service Endpoints allows connecting certain platform services into virtual networks.  With this option, Azure virtual machines can interact with Azure SQL and Azure Storage accounts, as if theyâ€™re part of the same virtual network, rather than Azure virtual machines accessing them over the public endpoint.

This module supports enabling the service endpoint of your choosing under the virtual network and with the specified subnet. The list of Service endpoints to associate with the subnet values include: `Microsoft.AzureActiveDirectory`, `Microsoft.AzureCosmosDB`, `Microsoft.ContainerRegistry`, `Microsoft.EventHub`, `Microsoft.KeyVault`, `Microsoft.ServiceBus`, `Microsoft.Sql`, `Microsoft.Storage` and `Microsoft.Web`.

> **Recommendation: It is recommended to set as few service endpoints as possible on Spoke subnets. Storage Endpoint is useful and doesn't clutter the firewall logs. Besides, add other endpoints if those are absolutely necessary.**

```hcl
module "vnet-spoke" {
  source  = "kumarvna/caf-virtual-network-spoke/azurerm"
  version = "2.2.0"

  # .... omitted

  # Multiple Subnets, Service delegation, Service Endpoints
  subnets = {
    mgnt_subnet = {
      subnet_name           = "management"
      subnet_address_prefix = "10.2.2.0/24"

      service_endpoints     = ["Microsoft.Storage"]  
    }
  }

# ....omitted

}
```

## `private_endpoint_network_policies_enabled` - Private Link Endpoint on the subnet

Network policies, like network security groups (NSG), are not supported for Private Link Endpoints. In order to deploy a Private Link Endpoint on a given subnet, you must set the `private_endpoint_network_policies_enabled` attribute to `true`. This setting is only applicable for the Private Link Endpoint, for all other resources in the subnet access is controlled based via the Network Security Group which can be configured using the `azurerm_subnet_network_security_group_association` resource.

This module Enable or Disable network policies for the private link endpoint on the subnet. The default value is `false`. If you are enabling the Private Link Endpoints on the subnet you shouldn't use Private Link Services as it's conflicts.

```hcl
module "vnet-spoke" {
  source  = "kumarvna/caf-virtual-network-spoke/azurerm"
  version = "2.2.0"

  # .... omitted

  # Multiple Subnets, Service delegation, Service Endpoints
  subnets = {
    mgnt_subnet = {
      subnet_name           = "management"
      subnet_address_prefix = "10.2.2.0/24"
      private_endpoint_network_policies_enabled = true

        }
      }
    }
  }

# ....omitted

}
```

## `private_link_service_network_policies_enabled` - private link service on the subnet

In order to deploy a Private Link Service on a given subnet, you must set the `private_link_service_network_policies_enabled` attribute to `true`. This setting is only applicable for the Private Link Service, for all other resources in the subnet access is controlled based on the Network Security Group which can be configured using the `azurerm_subnet_network_security_group_association` resource.

This module Enable or Disable network policies for the private link service on the subnet. The default value is `false`. If you are enabling the Private Link service on the subnet then, you shouldn't use Private Link endpoints as it's conflicts.

```hcl
module "vnet-spoke" {
  source  = "kumarvna/caf-virtual-network-spoke/azurerm"
  version = "2.2.0"

  # .... omitted

  # Multiple Subnets, Service delegation, Service Endpoints
  subnets = {
    mgnt_subnet = {
      subnet_name           = "management"
      subnet_address_prefix = "10.2.2.0/24"
      private_link_service_network_policies_enabled = true

        }
      }
    }
  }

# ....omitted

}
```

## Network Security Groups

By default, the network security groups connected to all subnets and only allow necessary traffic also block everything else (deny-all rule). Use `nsg_inbound_rules` and `nsg_outbound_rules` in this Terraform module to create a Network Security Group (NSG) for each subnet and allow it to add additional rules for inbound flows.

In the Source and Destination columns, `VirtualNetwork`, `AzureLoadBalancer`, and `Internet` are service tags, rather than IP addresses. In the protocol column, Any encompasses `TCP`, `UDP`, and `ICMP`. When creating a rule, you can specify `TCP`, `UDP`, `ICMP` or `*`. `0.0.0.0/0` in the Source and Destination columns represents all addresses.

>*You cannot remove the default rules, but you can override them by creating rules with higher priorities.*

```hcl
module "vnet-spoke" {
  source  = "kumarvna/caf-virtual-network-spoke/azurerm"
  version = "2.2.0"

  # .... omitted

  # Multiple Subnets, Service delegation, Service Endpoints
  subnets = {
    mgnt_subnet = {
      subnet_name           = "application"
      subnet_address_prefix = "10.2.2.0/24"

      nsg_inbound_rules = [
        # [name, priority, direction, access, protocol, destination_port_range, source_address_prefix, destination_address_prefix]
        # To use defaults, use "" without adding any value and to use this subnet as a source or destination prefix.
        ["weballow", "200", "Inbound", "Allow", "Tcp", "80", "*", ""],
        ["weballow1", "201", "Inbound", "Allow", "Tcp", "443", "*", ""],
      ]

      nsg_outbound_rules = [
        # [name, priority, direction, access, protocol, destination_port_range, source_address_prefix, destination_address_prefix]
        # To use defaults, use "" without adding any value and to use this subnet as a source or destination prefix.
        ["ntp_out", "103", "Outbound", "Allow", "Udp", "123", "", "0.0.0.0/0"],
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## Network Watcher

This module handle the provision of Network Watcher resource by defining `create_network_watcher` variable. It will enable network watcher, flow logs and traffic analytics for all the subnets in the Virtual Network. Since Azure uses a specific naming standard on network watchers, It will create a resource group `NetworkWatcherRG` and adds the location specific resource.

## Azure Monitoring Diagnostics

Platform logs in Azure, including the Azure Activity log and resource logs, provide detailed diagnostic and auditing information for Azure resources and the Azure platform they depend on. Platform metrics are collected by default and typically stored in the Azure Monitor metrics database. This module enables to send all the logs and metrics to either storage account, event hub or Log Analytics workspace.

## Peering to Hub

To peer spoke networks to the hub networks requires the service principal that performs the peering has `Network Contributor` role on hub network. Linking the Spoke to Hub DNS zones, the service principal also needs the `Private DNS Zone Contributor` role on hub network. If Log Analytics workspace is created in hub or another subscription then, the service principal must have `Log Analytics Contributor` role on workspace or a custom role to connect resources to workspace.

## Linking Hub Private DNS Zone

This module facilitates to link the spoke VNet to private DNS preferably created by Hub Module. To create a link to private DNS zone, set the domain name of the private DNS zone with variable `private_dns_zone_name`. This will always set automatic registration of records to `true`.  

## Recommended naming and tagging conventions

Applying tags to your Azure resources, resource groups, and subscriptions to logically organize them into a taxonomy. Each tag consists of a name and a value pair. For example, you can apply the name `Environment` and the value `Production` to all the resources in production.
For recommendations on how to implement a tagging strategy, see Resource naming and tagging decision guide.

>**Important** :
Tag names are case-insensitive for operations. A tag with a tag name, regardless of the casing, is updated or retrieved. However, the resource provider might keep the casing you provide for the tag name. You'll see that casing in cost reports. **Tag values are case-sensitive.**

An effective naming convention assembles resource names by using important resource information as parts of a resource's name. For example, using these [recommended naming conventions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/azure-best-practices/naming-and-tagging#example-names), a public IP resource for a production SharePoint workload is named like this: `pip-sharepoint-prod-westus-001`.
